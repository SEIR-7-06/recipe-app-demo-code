Recipe App Props Lesson:

🗒️ Lesson Plan:
    * Construct Component Hierarchy Tree Diagram
    * Explore the concept of SPAs (Single Page Applications)
    * Understand dynamic rendering
    * Challenge our understanding of props

* 💡 Single Page Application (SPA)
    - In a SPA, the application dynamically re-renders portions
    of the webpage w/ new content, rather than navigating to
    new or different webpages.

* Single Source of Truth Principle
    - For an application, the data must reside in, and 
    only be mutatable in one place.

* Where should our data live?
    - 

* 💡 Props
    - Data only flows downward from parent to child
    (and sometimes upwards)

* Dynamic rendering
    - Components can be rendered using input data
    and that data can be changed in the parent
